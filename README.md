# Software and Programming III

## Group Coursework

#### Session: 2023-24

Objectives
==========

The aims of this coursework assignment are to:

- learn how to understand and extend an existing codebase,

- focus on the essential (and relevant) packages within that codebase,

- work with packages,

- become accustomed to the features of modern Java,

- to see the use of Java concurrency via the threading model,

- to see the workings of a Java GUI application.

The code you have to write is relatively small, but the amount you have to read is quite large. We will be running
additional tutorials to help you with this assignment as we understand that it is complex, but you will learn a great
deal from completing the task.

Overview
========

In this assignment, you will help the explorer and Professor of Finance, Jeremy Hunt, claim the *Orb of Lots* in the *Temple of Gloom*. You will help him explore an unknown cavern under the temple, claim the orb, and escape before the entrance collapses. There will be great rewards for those who help Jeremy fill his pockets with gold on the way out.
There are two principal phases to this assignment:

- the *exploration phase*, and

- the *escape phase*,

Each of these involves writing a different method in Java. We explain these phases in detail after presenting some
additional introductory material.

The exploration phase
=====================

On the way to the Orb (see Figure[1](#1), the cavern's layout is unknown. You know only the status of the tile on which
you are standing and those immediately around you and perhaps those that you remember. Your goal is to make it to the
Orb in as few steps as possible.

![Searching for the Orb during the exploration
phase](images/exploration.png){#1 width="\\textwidth"}

This is not a blind search, as you will know the distance to the Orb. This equals the number of tiles on the shortest path to the Orb if there weren't walls or obstacles.

You will develop the solution to this phase in the method `explore()` class `Explorer` within the
package `student`. There is no time limit on the number of steps you can take, but you will receive a higher score for
finding the Orb in fewer steps. Return from this method to pick up the Orb once you have arrived on its tile. Returning
when Jeremy is not on the Orb tile will cause an exception to be thrown, halting the game.

When writing the method `explore()`, you are given an `ExplorationState` object to learn about your environment. Every
time you move, this object automatically changes to reflect the new location of the explorer. This object includes the
following methods:

`long getCurrentLocation()`: returns a unique identifier for the tile the explorer is currently on.

`int getDistanceToTarget()`: returns the distance from the explorer's current location to the Orb.

`Collection<NodeStatus> getNeighbours()`: return information about the tiles to which the explorer can move from their
current location.

`void moveTo(long id)`: move the explorer to the tile with ID id. This fails if that tile is not adjacent to the current
location.

Note that the method `getNeighbours()` returns a collection of `NodeStatus` objects. This is simply an object that
contains, for each neighbour, the ID corresponding to that neighbour and that neighbour's distance from the Orb.
You can examine the documentation for this class for more information on how to use `NodeStatus` objects. A suggested
first implementation that will always find the Orb but likely won't receive a significant bonus score is a
depth-first search. More advanced solutions might incorporate the distance of tiles from the Orb.

The escape phase
================

After picking up the Orb, the walls of the cavern shift and a new layout is generated --- ouch! In addition, piles of
gold fall onto the ground. Luckily, underneath the Orb is a map, revealing the full cavern to you. However, the stress
of the moving walls has compromised the integrity of the cavern, beginning a time limit after which the ceiling will
collapse, crushing Jeremy! Additionally, picking up the Orb activated the traps and puzzles of the cavern, causing
different edges of the graph to have different weights.

![Collecting gold during the escape phase](images/escape.png){#2

The goal of the escape phase is to make it to the cavern's entrance before it collapses. However, a score component is
based on two additional factors:

1. The amount of gold that you pick up during the escape phase and

2. Your score from the exploration phase.

Your score will be the amount of gold picked up times the score from the exploration phase.

You will write your solution code to this part of the problem in a method `escape()` in the class `Explorer` in the
package `student`. To escape, return from this method while standing on the entrance tile. Returning while at any
other position or failing to return before time runs out will cause the game to end and result in a score of 0.

An important point to clarify is that *time* during this phase is not defined as the CPU time your solution takes to
compute but rather the number of steps the explorer takes: the time remaining decrements regardless of how long you
spent deciding which move to make. Because of this, you can be guaranteed always to be given enough time to escape the
cavern should you take the shortest path out. Note that there are differing amounts of gold on the different tiles.
Picking up gold on the tile you are standing on takes no time.

When writing this method, you are given an `EscapeState` object to learn about your environment. Every time you move,
this object will automatically change to reflect the new location of the explorer. This object includes the following
methods:

`Node getCurrentNode()`: return the `Node` corresponding to the explorer's location.

`Node getExit()`: return the `Node` corresponding to the exit to the cavern (the destination).

`Collection<Node> getVertices()`: returns a collection of all traversable nodes in the graph.

`int getTimeRemaining()`: return the number of steps the explorer has left before the ceiling collapses.

`void moveTo(Node n)`: move the explorer to node n. This will fail if the given node is not adjacent to the explorer's
current location. Calling this function will decrease the time remaining.

`void pickUpGold()`: Collect all gold on the current tile. This will fail if there is no gold on the current tile or if
it has already been collected.

Class `Node` (and the corresponding class `Edge`) has methods that are likely to be useful. Look at the documentation
for these classes to learn what additional methods are available. A good starting point is to write an implementation
that will always escape the cavern before time runs out. From there, you can consider trying to pick up gold to optimise
your score using more advanced techniques.

However, the most critical part is always that your solution successfully escapes the cavern----- if you improve on
your solution, make sure that it never fails to escape in time!

The provided code
=================

You will have downloaded the provided classes from `GitHub` by cloning this repository. The difference between this and
previous worksheets/coursework is that we have only given you the class files (don't reverse engineer the source code,
which will ruin the exercise's point). You should see four packages: `game`, `gui`, `student`, and `main`.
The ' student` package is where you will be writing your code.

The program can be run from two classes within the `main` package. Running the `main` method from the class `TXTmain`
executes the program in headless mode (without a GUI); running it from `GUImain` runs it with an accompanying display,
which may help debug. Each of these runs a single map on a random seed by default. If you run the program before any
solution code is written, you should see the explorer stand still, and an error message pops up telling you that you
returned from `explore()` without having found the Orb. It would be best if you started by trying this to check that the
code compiles correctly.

Two optional flags can be used to run the program in different ways:

`-n <count>`: runs the program multiple times. This option is available only in headless mode and is ignored if run with
the GUI. The output will still be written to the console for each map so you know how well you did, and an average score
will be provided at the end. This helps run your solution many times and compare different solutions on many maps.

`-s <seed>`: runs the program with a predefined seed. This allows you to test your solutions on particular maps that can
be challenging or that you might be failing on and thus is quite helpful for debugging. This can be used both with the
GUI and in headless mode.

For instance, to run the program 100 times in headless mode, write:

    java main.TXTmain -n 100

To run the program once with a seed of 1050, write:

    java main.GUImain -s 1050   

You may combine these flags, but if you run the program more than once and provide the seed, it will run the program on the same map (the map generated by that seed) every time.

The GUI
=======

When running your program (except in headless mode), you are presented with a GUI where you can watch the explorer
making moves. When the GUI is running, each call to `moveTo()` blocks until the corresponding move completes on the GUI
----- that is when you make a call to `moveTo()`, that call will not return, and consequently, your code will not
continue running until the corresponding animation on the GUI has been completed. Therefore, running your code in
headless mode will generally complete faster than running it with the GUI.

You can use the slider on the right side of the GUI to increase or decrease the speed of the explorer. Increasing the
speed will make the animation finish faster. Reducing the rate might help debug and better understand
what exactly your solution is doing. Also, a timer displays the number of steps remaining during the escape phase (both
as a number and a percentage). A `Print Seed` button lets you print the seed to the console to easily copy and
paste it into the program arguments to retry your solution on a challenging map. You can also see the `bonus` and the
number of coins collected, followed by the final score computed as the product. The bonus multiplier begins at `1.3` and
slowly decreases as you take more and more steps during the explore stage (after which it is fixed), while the number of
coins increases as you collect them during the escape phase. Finally, click on any square in the map to see more
detailed information on the right, including its row and column, the type of tile, and the amount of gold on that
square.

The deliverables
================

+ The assignment must follow the usual `add/commit/push` cycle; it will be automatically cloned on the due date as part
  of your portfolio submission.
+ You must upload your classes, documentation, and unit tests as part of your submission.
+ You should include full `javadoc` for your classes (most of which is provided for you anyway).
+ You must include a `README_WHAT_I_DIDTH.md` file detailing the project and any limitations/problems with
  your submission. It should also include a list of the files/classes you have created/modified.

You are encouraged to have everything ready well in advance ----- both the programming and pushing it to your `GitHub` repository ----- to avoid any last-minute problems (e.g., `GitHub` may be down for maintenance).

Grading
=======

The assignment will be graded according to its ability to fulfil the requirements the simplicity, clarity, and
The generality of the code (including succinct but illustrative comments and `JavaDoc`) and compliance with good
practices of coding and version control as outlined during the module (e.g., committing often and in small pieces, use
of descriptive commit messages, committing only source code and **not binary or `.class` files**).

The vast majority of points on this assignment will come from a correct solution that always finds the Orb and escapes
before the time runs out, so your priority should be to ensure that your code always does this successfully. To receive
full credit for the assignment, your solution must also get a reasonably high score (achieved by optimising the bonus
multiplier in the explore phase and collecting as many coins as possible in the escape phase), so you should spend some
time thinking about ways to optimise your solution. While the time your code takes to decide its next move
does not factor into the number of steps taken or the time remaining and consequently does not affect your score, we
cannot wait for your code forever and so must impose a timeout when grading your code. When running in headless mode,
your code should take no longer than roughly 10 seconds to complete any single map.

Solutions that take significantly longer may be treated as if they were not completed and will likely receive low grades.

**Using Java Reflection mechanisms is strictly forbidden and will result in significant penalties.**
